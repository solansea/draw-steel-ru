Whenever a creature moves or is subjected to forced movement—a push, pull, or slide (see [Chapter 10: Combat](#page-288-0))—that movement is typically in a straight line. Abilities that allow you to move or to force move another creature often talk about moving straight toward or away from a creature or an object. But even when movement must be in a straight line, it doesn't have to be a horizontal or vertical line on an encounter map. (See the [Straight Lines](#page-85-10) sidebar earlier in this chapter.)
