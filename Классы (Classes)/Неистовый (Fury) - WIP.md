## Fury

You do not temper the heat of battle within you. You unleash it! Your experience in the wild taught you the secrets of predators, and now, like the raptor, the panther, the wolf, you channel unfettered anger into martial prowess. Primordial Chaos is your ally. Let others use finesse to clean up the wreckage left in your wake.

**As a fury, you devastate foes with overwhelming might, hurl yourself and enemies around the battlefield, and grow stronger as your ferocity increases. Nature has no concept of fairness—and neither do you.**

### Особенности 1-го уровня

На 1-м уровне Ярости вы получаете следующие особенности.
#### Первобытный Аспект

Вы — дитя обычаев, что древнее войны, древнее цивилизации, древнее большей части мира. Вы прошли обряд инициации, открывший вам строительные блоки таймскейпа — Первобытный Хаос — и оставивший частицу этого хаоса внутри вас. Выбираете один Первобытный аспект из предложенных ниже; каждый из них даёт вам один Навык. (_Быстрая сборка:_ Берсерк - Berserker.)

- **Берсерк (Berserker):** Вы направляете свою свирепость в физическую Силу, становясь живым воплощением сил, что формируют мир. Вы получаете навык Перемещение (Lift).    
- **Разоритель (Reaver):** Вы направляете свою свирепость в Интуицию и хитрость, бросая вызов порядку цивилизации. Вы получаете навык Прятаться (Hide).    
- **Буревестник (Stormwight):** Вы направляете свою свирепость в первобытные бури и способны принимать облик зверя или гибридную форму зверя. Вы получаете навык Выслеживание (Track).

Ваш Первобытный аспект — это черта вашего подкласса, и выбор аспекта определяет многие особенности, которые вы получите на новых уровнях.

#### Свирепость

В разгар битвы ваша решимость и ярость нарастают, подпитывая Героический Ресурс под названием **Свирепость**.

> **Где мои Манёвры?**
> 
> Поскольку большинство других классов получает уникальный Манёвр, вы можете спросить: «А где особый манёвр для Неистового?» Ответ в том, что классу он просто не нужен, ведь чаще всего воображение рисует образ Неистового, который использует **Манёвр Захват (Grab)** или **Манёвр Отталкивание (Knockback)** в бою. Неистовый действительно великолепно владеет этими манёврами, поэтому нет смысла давать вам ещё один вариант, который вы будете использовать редко или вовсе никогда.

##### Ferocity in Combat

At the start of a combat encounter or some other stressful situation tracked in combat rounds (as determined by the Director), you gain ferocity equal to your Victories. At the start of each of your turns during combat, you gain 1d3 ferocity.

Additionally, the first time each combat round that you take damage, you gain 1 ferocity. The first time you become winded or are dying in an encounter, you gain 1d3 ferocity.

You lose any remaining ferocity at the end of the encounter.

##### Ferocity Outside of Combat

Though you can't gain ferocity outside of combat, you can use your heroic abilities and effects that cost ferocity without spending it. Whenever you use an ability or effect outside of combat that costs ferocity, you can't use that same ability or effect outside of combat again until you earn 1 or more Victories or finish a respite.

When you use an ability outside of combat that lets you spend unlimited ferocity on its effect, such as To the Uttermost End, you can use it as if you had spent an amount of ferocity equal to your Victories.

#### Growing Ferocity

You gain certain benefits in combat based on the amount of ferocity you have (see 1st-Level Aspect Features for details). These benefits last until the end of your turn, even if a benefit would become unavailable to you because of the amount of ferocity you spend during your turn.

Some Growing Ferocity benefits can be applied only if you are a specific level or higher, with the level of those benefits noted in the various Growing Ferocity tables in this section.
