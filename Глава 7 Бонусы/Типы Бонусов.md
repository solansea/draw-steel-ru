Six types of perks are available to your character. Five of those types reflect the setup of the five skill groups (see [Skills](#page-268-0) in Chapter 9: Tests), and feature many perks related to the skills from those groups. The sixth type of perk allows characters of all types access to supernatural power.

**Crafting perks** improve your talent for crafting materials, and let you become an expert in the things you create.

**Exploration perks** let you better traverse and explore different environments.

**Interpersonal perks** improve your interactions with other creatures.

**Intrigue perks** make you more effective at investigating mysteries and finding the truth, even as you keep your own secrets hidden.

**Lore perks** improve your mastery of memory, language, and knowledge across a range of topics.

**Supernatural perks** let you use magic and psionics to influence the world around you.

Whenever a feature allows you to gain a perk, that feature tells you which type of perk to choose.
